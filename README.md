## Visualizing evolving narratives in regional economic conditions

The Federal Reserve Sytem's Beige Book reports contain anecdotes from a variety of sources. There are eight reports every year covering each of the 12 districts and a national summary, or about 5000 documents. The motivation behind the current project is to use recent advances in compuational linguistics and natural language processing to try and visualize changes in these narratives across regions, sectors and time.
